title: I Chose a PC as a Machine Learning Engineer
listing: System Blogs
---

I recently got myself a new computer â€“ one with a powerful CPU and a fancy graphics card ðŸ˜„. My aim was to have a system that would support both my personal tasks and my learning adventures. Since I was planning to leave my job and didn't have a personal computer of my own, I put a lot of thought into what to buy and what configuration to choose. Ultimately, I decided to go for a high-end PC. Let me break down why I made this choice over getting a laptop.

<!-- Recently I bought a system (big CPU with graphic card ðŸ˜„). I Wanted a system where I can do all my personal work and learning. I was going to leave my job and I had no personal system of me. After carefull consideration of what to buy with what configuration I decided to by a PC with high end configuration. Few reasons I though for going for a system instead of laptop. Here I'll be explaining one by one. -->

<!-- 0. Fit Your choices: Buying a loptop is like sticking to one configuration. In few laptops you can increate ram but loptops like macbook doen't even have that freedom. So you'll be sticked to same prosessor, hard drive and motherboard. Where as in PC its you'll be deciding what you take. And there a plenty of options to go with. Main intention for building a PC should be extensibility and future ready. being a machine learning developer and the release of LLM we are in dare need of heavly GPUs and GPUs server are costly and loptops like mac doesn't comes with GPU. So when I'm buying a PC i'll choose according to my current needs and my future requirement.  -->
<!-- 1. Hardware Extensibility (add gpu): Talking about future requirements sooner or latter we'll need to ram, gpus, hard drive or change processor. Yes in PC you are free to change (within restriction of motherboard support) or upgrade to new version. And you'll bear the cost of the only part your chanding/adding. I can sell my old Processor to buy a new one. This comes with carefull consideration of what hardware you are taking. PC's also have support restrictions. Best way to suffice your current need and future needs is to assable pc on PCStudio.in before buying hardwares. This website will highlight missing components and compatibility error. Also adding extra things for future readyness. For example, Currenly I bought one Nvidia RTX 3060 GPU for this and current system I needed power supply unit of less that 700 WATT. But when I add one more GPU it'll need around 1000 WATT. So I bougth 1000 WATT power supply using. -->
<!-- 2. keep it running without interuption: I'm a Machine Learning Engineer my daily task is to evaluate models, train it on data, do data transformation and the deploy it. All these things need time even on best best Hardware. On PC it is every easy as I keep it running and do whatever I like and come back when its done. PC have better air flow and can be add with liquid cooling give it an advantage over Laptops. Even now having 4 fans in my unit i'm considering add two more I don't know how laptop user bear the heating ( ohh they don't have GPUs ðŸ˜„). I keep my notebooks running, models training on my PC without any headache.  -->
<!-- 3. use it as server: I was a full stack developer before doing ML. I know end to end deployment pipeline of weather it be a frontend, backend or ML. laptops are not every usefull for deploying server. Which PC i'm enabled to build a project and start a service from My pc directly as MVP (mininum viable product). Doing it in could service can cost me $$ if I forget to stop this machine ( I'm a big forgettor ).   -->
<!-- 5. Cooling and thermal Management: Nothing so say here.  -->
<!-- 6. Cost Effective: I had a option to buy a new macbook air 2023. It is so alluring. My friend suggested to wait for sometime before deciding. Was spending 1 Lakh 30 Thousands on laptop with 8gb ram and 265 ssd. I agree M2 processor give better performance than intel for certain task. Buying this laptop I was sure I can do basic ML stuffs on it. It was when I'm cycling I go idea of going for a PC (yes do start cycling and walking for get good ideas). I used PCStudio and added best hardwares in the market (Not GPUs ðŸ¥¹). And then tweaked few things. Intially I was very happly after adding porocessor, ram, motherboard and gpu as costing ware below 1 Lakh. But then I find out I have to add other stuffs like cooling, power supply unit, case and ups. And my costing came to 1 Lakh 50 Thousands. But for it It was still better than laptop with no GPU and less configuration. I was getting i7 13gen processor, 32 GP ddr5 ram, Nvidia 3060 RTX 12GB ram and best motherboard in the market.  -->

<!-- While having many upsides there are downsides also. PCs can't be taken anywhere with you like laptop can be. But for my requirement I don't want my system with me always as I have to close it when I'm not doing anything and cannot keep it running. It is better for me to buy a budget laptop (maybe second hand) and ssh into my PC. Well there are problems in setting up a proper ssh into personal PC which i'll be discussing in next blogs.  -->

# Freedom to Choose

When you buy a laptop, you're pretty much stuck with whatever configuration it comes with. Some laptops allow you to increase the memory (RAM), but others, like MacBooks, don't even give you that option. With a PC, you have the power to decide everything. There are lots of options, so you can create the computer that's just right for you. Spending 3 - 4 days on pcstudio.in/pc-build/ I finnaly got a fit for my budget and was getting more then I expected. Its good to do research before deciding and pcstudio.in/pc-build/ is a best site for it.

# Room to Grow

As a Machine Learning Engineer, I knew I'd need a system that can handle heavy tasks, especially those that require powerful graphics cards (GPUs). And as technology keeps advancing, I'd need to upgrade things like RAM, GPUs, and hard drives or even change the processor. With a PC, you're free to do that. You can upgrade or change parts whenever you need to. I suggest adding extra things for future readyness on pcstudio.in. For example, I bought one Nvidia RTX 3060 GPU which needed power supply unit of less that 700 WATT with overall system. But when I add one more GPU itâ€™ll need around 9000 WATT. So I bougth 1000 WATT power supply using just to keep my system ready for one more GPU. Laptops don't give you that kind of freedom.

# No Interruptions

In my work, I spend a lot of time training computer models and doing data stuff. These tasks take a while, even on the best hardware. With my PC, I can start a task and let it run while I do other things. It's like putting dinner in the oven and going for a walk â€“ you come back when it's done. PCs have better cooling, so they don't get too hot, unlike laptops. This is especially important when you're working with powerful GPUs. I tried fine-tunning Llama 7B chat model in 4Bit which took a day. I would have been hard on laptop to train such a big model. One can argue to use free collab but it kills inactive sessions and gives limited time access to GPU.

# PC as a Personal Server

Before diving into Machine Learning, I used to build websites and backends, as I was Full-Stack Developer. PCs are fantastic for that too! I can use my PC like a personal server to test things out and put on production. It's like having a mini version of personal cloud with GPU. This means I can start a project and show it off without spending money on cloud services. Plus, I don't have to worry about turning off a cloud computer â€“ I can just keep my PC running.

# More Value for Money

Some laptops look really cool, like the MacBooks. But they can be expensive and not as powerful as they appear. With the same amount of money, you can get a PC that's much stronger. It's like getting a race car for the price of a regular car. My PC has a speedy processor, lots of memory (32GB RAM), and a strong graphics card (Nvidia RTX 3060). All together, it's like having a superhero squad in my computer!

# Conclusion

Choosing between a PC and a laptop depends on what you need. For me, a PC was the best choice because it's flexible, powerful, and ready for the future. If I need to be on the move, I'll grab a simple laptop and connect to my PC remotely. In my next blog, I'll show you how I set up this remote control for my PC.
