# Installing Operating System

The first step is to select an operating system. For tech enthusiasts, the choice between Ubuntu and Windows is straightforward. Ubuntu, as an open-source and free software, is actively maintained and inherently safer than Windows.

When installing Ubuntu for the first time, it's advisable to opt for a stable version. I initially chose 22.04, but encountered GPU issues. Researching online, I discovered that 20.04 currently enjoys comprehensive software support. I installed the Desktop version as I require a Graphical User Interface. Here's how to set up Ubuntu Desktop:

1. Download the Ubuntu .iso file. For 20.04, I obtained the Ubuntu Desktop from [this link](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/).

2. Install [BalenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) and have a USB pendrive handy. Creating a bootable pendrive with BalenaEtcher's intuitive GUI takes approximately 10-20 minutes.

3. Plug the Pendrive into your PC, start it up, and press F11 multiple times to access the boot device selection. Choose the pendrive to begin the Ubuntu installation.

# Disk Partitions

In Ubuntu most of your data will be saved in /home folder where users data is present. Linux systems can break anytime and separating /home data from OS data is recommended so that whenever system break we reinstall OS without touching /home dir. It is supported using disk partitions. While installing Ubuntu it gives nice GUI for creating partitions in disk using that mount a separate partition for /home and / [root]. 

If you are late like me then don't worry. flow below blog post from ubuntu to setup it

[Ubuntu Partitioning/Home/Moving](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving)

While installing Ubuntu I had 512GB drive from which I assigned 150GB to root [/] and 32GB as swp memory and remaining for /home dir. Somehow /home was not mounted and I found out when I got disk full. Following above blog solved my issue. 


# Setting up Browser

A programmer's initial task on a new operating system is to install a browser. While Ubuntu comes preloaded with Firefox, I prefer Chrome due to its seamless integration with Google accounts. After logging into Chrome with my Gmail, activating sync restores my extensions, bookmarks, and login credentials within just 5 minutes. To install Chrome, open Firefox and visit the [Chrome website](https://www.google.com/chrome/), then click the download button. On Ubuntu, a .dmg file will be downloaded. Double-clicking it opens the Ubuntu Software window with an install button. After installation, turning on sync brings back all your settings.

# Installing Nvidia Drivers and CUDA

On Ubuntu 20.04, installing Nvidia drivers is as simple as a single line:

```sudo apt install nvidia-driver-440```

# Installing Python with Conda

Conda serves as an environment management system for Python, simplifying version management. Using a single environment for everything can eventually lead to version conflicts. Conda is ideal for creating separate environments for individual projects. Follow these steps to install Conda: [link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html).

Download the Anaconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh file and execute the following command:

```bash Anaconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh```

To create a new Python environment with a specific version, use this one-liner:

```conda create -n <env_name> python=3.10```

To activate environment

```conda activate <env_name>```

Optional:
Similar to Conda for Python, consider installing Node Version Manager (NVM) and Ruby Version Manager (RVM) for Node.js and Ruby. It's safer to use version managers instead of direct installations.

# Navigating Jupyter and Conda Environments

Jupyter comes pre-installed within the conda base environment. However, there are instances where we might want to utilize Jupyter in conjunction with a specific environment we've created. Simply activating the desired environment and launching Jupyter won't suffice. A series of steps must be taken to seamlessly integrate your environment with Jupyter.

Commence by installing the **ipykernel** package to your designated environment:

```bash
conda activate <env_name>
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
```

Having completed the installation, proceed to incorporate your environment into Jupyter:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<env_name>
```

With this integration, your \<env_name\> environment becomes accessible within Jupyter. To utilize it, navigate to **Kernel** > **Change Kernel** and select your preferred kernel before executing your code.

# Testing CUDA

Before proceeding, it's wise to test the Nvidia driver installation. Run the following command:

``` nvidia-smi ```

If this command displays GPU statistics, the driver installation is successful. Next, check CUDA compatibility.

Install PyTorch in the base Conda environment:

```pip install torch```

Open the Python interpreter in interactive mode:

``` python ```

Run the following lines one by one:

```python
import torch
torch.cuda.is_available()
# Output: True
example = torch.tensor([0.2, 0.5])
example.to('cuda')
# Output: tensor([0.2000, 0.5000], device='cuda:0')
```

If there are no errors and the output matches, your system is ready for handling large models on the GPU.

# Installing Kinto (Optional for Mac Keyboard Layout)

Having used a Mac for some time, I became accustomed to its keybindings. Switching to Windows keyboard layouts was a challenge, so I opted to use a Mac keyboard with Ubuntu. [Kinto.sh](https://kinto.sh/) is a software that enables Mac-style shortcuts on Ubuntu. Installing Kinto requires running this relatively lengthy command:

```/bin/bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbreaves/kinto/HEAD/install/linux.sh || curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbreaves/kinto/HEAD/install/linux.sh)"```

# Choosing a Text Editor

Next, install your preferred text editorâ€”whether it's VS Code, Vim, NeoVim, or PyCharm. You can directly install VS Code from the Ubuntu Software Store. For Vim and NeoVim, one line in the terminal is sufficient:

```sudo apt-get install vim```

```sudo apt-get install neovim```

For PyCharm, visit their [website](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#f956621e).

# Conclusion
Setting up a PC for machine learning is a vital step in establishing a robust development environment. With Ubuntu as the chosen operating system, the foundation is laid for a safe and actively maintained platform. The process of installation, from selecting the version to configuring the desktop, ensures a smooth start to your journey.

This guide offers a comprehensive roadmap for initial setting up a machine learning-ready PC, equipping you with the essential tools to embark on your coding and learning endeavors with confidence and efficiency.
